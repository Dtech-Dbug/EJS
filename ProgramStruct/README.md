#### Expressions

- Every block/line of code that produces a value is called an expression.
- Every value written literally like 'Programmer' or 'JavaScript' or any numerics like 2 is an expression.
- An Expression within a parenthesis (expression) is also an expression.
- Unary or Binary Operations involving expressions is also an expression.

## Program Structures

#### Expressions

- Every block/line of code that produces a value is called an expression.
- Every value written literally like 'Programmer' or 'JavaScript' or any numerics like 2 is an expression.
- An Expression within a parenthesis (expression) is also an expression.
- Unary or Binary Operations involving expressions is also an expression.

This is the beauty of language based interface - as most of English can be directly used in logic formation and deductions.

Consider the following example below :

> If the program has bugs or the program involves division by 0. The program will crash.

This is an excellent example of the beauty of language based interface. The above example is really comprised of two sentences :

- If the program has bugs
  **OR**
- If the program involves division by 0

We used two sub sentences to form a single sentence - and similarly two sub expressions to form a single expression.

The above example is essentially a _conditional statement._ in the form of if(p or q) then r.
Where p , q, r are just statement variables which can be substituted by actual english.

**_If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript statement corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements._**

**Note :** A statement is an expression that has a consistent truth value. i.e, it can either be true or false but never both. On the contrary, a sentence is an expression that bears inconsistent truth values meaning for some cases it may be true and other cases false.
